# gotour

This project contains some exercises that I implemented while following the GoLang tour (https://tour.golang.org).

Extra tools used:

- `go vendor` for modules (dependencies management)
- `github.com/stretchr/testify` for test asserts
- `golang.org/x/tour` library is needed as a dependency for some GoTour exercises
